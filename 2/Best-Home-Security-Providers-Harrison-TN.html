<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
