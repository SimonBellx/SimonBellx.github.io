In a network injection attack, a hacker can make use of gain access to points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically transmitting network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that impact routers, switches, and smart centers. A whole network can be reduced in this way and require rebooting or perhaps reprogramming of all smart networking devices.</p>
