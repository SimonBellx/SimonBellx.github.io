<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I just had issues. The switch from daylight to night vision took about 5 minutes (though it worked fine changing from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was carrying out the macarena in front of the camera for about 2 minutes prior to it even observed I existed. </p>
