<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send notifies, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
