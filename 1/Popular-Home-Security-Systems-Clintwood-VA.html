<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensors. Most radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet.

They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your home.
