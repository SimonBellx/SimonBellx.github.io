<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
