<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.
