<p>Most importantly, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically two years of use, day and night images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when testing the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion identified. We've seen it highlight moths, cars, and mice.</p>
<p>Costs for systems differ. Bigger systems that provide full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most pricey options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly option. Remember that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>
