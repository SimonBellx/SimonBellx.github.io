<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
