<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smart device signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
