<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can compare general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
