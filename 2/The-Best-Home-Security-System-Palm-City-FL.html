<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've evaluated.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
