<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>

Both the initial House system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we checked that likewise deals with HomeKit.
