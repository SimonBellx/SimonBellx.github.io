If the system was not installed during the homebuilding process, setting one up may require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and accessing to tough spots that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are likewise vulnerable to power outages. Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a blackout, but long term blackouts will result in the system losing power. It's also essential to think about the length of time you plan to stay at the same house when picking a wired system. Since these security systems are integrated into the home's circuitry, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>
