On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a lots of other wise home tech to the system. It won't deal with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely outstanding, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you journey the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting chance for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking police authorities in Washington, DC was caught using police databases to collect details on patrons of a gay club.
