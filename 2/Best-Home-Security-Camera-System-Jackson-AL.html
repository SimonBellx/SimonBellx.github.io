As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
