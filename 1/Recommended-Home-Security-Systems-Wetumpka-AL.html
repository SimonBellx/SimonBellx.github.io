<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was created for house owners. It should be set up by a professional alarm installation team and, as soon as set up, is hard to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for big residential or commercial properties and are often more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to rework the existing wires in your house. If you've already set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system, the team will have the ability to reuse the existing wiring.
