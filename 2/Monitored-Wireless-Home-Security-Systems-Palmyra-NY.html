<p>We searched for DIY systems that provided expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies provide complimentary or heavily reduced hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile.

<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same method as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who really is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one!
