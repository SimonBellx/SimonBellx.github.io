<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
