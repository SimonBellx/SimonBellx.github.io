<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for".

This costs towns and cities countless dollars in squandered police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is easy and dependable to use, however expensive and eccentric unless you desire the convenience of a pro install and maintenance.</p>
<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
