<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smart device notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
