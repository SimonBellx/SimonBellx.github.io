<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
