<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
