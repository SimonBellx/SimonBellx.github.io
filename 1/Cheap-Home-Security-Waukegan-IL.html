<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". According to a report published by the Urban Institute, police departments across the country react to countless incorrect alarms from citizen and business security systems every year. This costs towns and cities millions of dollars in lost cops resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is easy and trusted to use, but expensive and wacky unless you want the benefit of a pro install and maintenance.</p>
<p>When purchasing a wireless home security system, you want to do adequate research to discover a brand name that has a good industry credibility and offers high-quality equipment.

<p>Customer support is Frontpoint's forte. While the company does not provide rather as many hours of client support as other brand names, it has a great track record with great deals of vocal, delighted clients.

Customers have to talk with their alarm company to determine these prices because they differ from company to company.</p>

There are 2 elements at play in an alarm response: the monitoring center's reaction time and your local police department's. The monitoring center related to your home security system must be informed within seconds of an alarm (and contact you soon after to confirm the cause).</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface uses extra info that may never have actually been possible in the past, such as alert of an employee, by name and identification number, getting in the building. An image of that employee is presented on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating takes place.</p>
