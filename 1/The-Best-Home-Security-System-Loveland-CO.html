<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, normally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as sometimes as you want.</p>
