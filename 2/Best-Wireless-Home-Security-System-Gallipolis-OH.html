We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
