<p>Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro: As security system cameras go, the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is one of the best-- and it will deal with the rest of your Vivint system. The small, black orb of a dome camera provides a much better field of view than its bullet equivalent. It's likewise more subtle, more long lasting types of security cameras on the market.
