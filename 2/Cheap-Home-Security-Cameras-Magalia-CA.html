<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has spotted trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
