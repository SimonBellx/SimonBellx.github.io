<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to overlook things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
