<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>The disadvantage? It's extremely simple to commit security mistakes that will leave your home vulnerable. The moment you drive out of signal variety or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the moment you have actually left your house open. This open hole in your security can show to be a huge problem if you aren't mindful. With a monitored system, that would not be a problem. Nevertheless, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to contact the cops or other emergency situation services if your home remains in threat. Still, the unmonitored system is much less costly and therefore is still the better choice for lots of who are only concerned about cost. </p>
