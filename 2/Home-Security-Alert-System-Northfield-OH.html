<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
