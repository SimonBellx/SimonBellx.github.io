<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which might be an inexpensive choice for customers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems since they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the patio by a certified electrical contractor (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which provide numerous other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and enables systems to be scaled up much more quickly than can be finished with DVR.
