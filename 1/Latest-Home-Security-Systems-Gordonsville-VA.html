<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I just had problems. The switch from daytime to night vision took about 5 minutes (though it worked great changing from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about 2 minutes before it even saw I was there. </p>
