<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
