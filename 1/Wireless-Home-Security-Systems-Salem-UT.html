Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
