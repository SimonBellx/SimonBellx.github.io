<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see exactly when a specific person comes to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.
