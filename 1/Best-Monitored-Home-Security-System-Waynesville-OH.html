<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system spots a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it notifies the security team and, in many cases, emergency situation responders. Sadly, history has revealed that surveillance innovations put in location for one function inevitably broaden into other usages. And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant risk.</p>
<p>Reliability is a highly subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending on which features and benefits an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connection are still common problems. Hardwired systems require minimal maintenance, and except a basic power interruption, are more difficult to interrupt. Regardless of a general improvement in wireless innovation, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and immobilized. </p>
