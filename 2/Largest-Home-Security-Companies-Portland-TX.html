<p>Different kinds of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup process. This generally includes finding an area for your camera, developing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was captured utilizing cops databases to collect details on patrons of a gay club. By searching for the license plate varieties of parking area at the club and researching the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he tried to blackmail clients who were married. Imagine what somebody like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

And while this is a quite standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
