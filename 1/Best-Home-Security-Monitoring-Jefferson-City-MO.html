We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate inside or indoors - you get a lot of versatility from this little device.
