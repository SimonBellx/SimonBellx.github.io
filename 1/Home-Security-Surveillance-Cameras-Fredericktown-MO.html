<p>I explained that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
