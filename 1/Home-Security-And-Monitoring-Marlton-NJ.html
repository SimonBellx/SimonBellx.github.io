<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a learning duration).
