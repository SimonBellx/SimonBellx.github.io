<h2>The History Of Home Security Waterford</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of numerous cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which tape-recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor.

Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped.

<p>There's no dedicated center included here - each camera links straight to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a neat solution, or at least one that conserves a power socket and an Ethernet port, but we can't assist but feel it's also the reason for the Swann's slightly sluggish reaction times.</p>

IP cameras are the more modern version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a little bit more costly, they offer a variety of features that analog cameras do not.
