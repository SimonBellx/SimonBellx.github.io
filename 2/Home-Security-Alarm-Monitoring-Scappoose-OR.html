<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
