Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing games for a very long time and a great deal of the things in earlier games I have actually played a decade earlier would definitely NEVER make the cut in todays politically charged gaming environment.</p>

And that's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>Throughout our testing, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a more detailed look. We especially like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of view, because you're less likely to get a blind spot wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

<p>So far so regular. Things begin to get truly fascinating with the Nest's facial recognition system.
