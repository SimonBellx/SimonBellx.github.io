<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over two months.</p>
