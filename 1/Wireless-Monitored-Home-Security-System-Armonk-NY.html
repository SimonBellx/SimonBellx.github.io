<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a priority.</p>
