<p>If you do experience a home invasion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however practically all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is tape-recording.
