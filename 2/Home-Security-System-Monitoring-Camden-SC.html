When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

On the other hand, if running wires isn't realistic, you'll take pleasure in the flexibility that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras provide. All these factors to consider will impact what system you ultimately select. For example, if you need to record high-definition surveillance video over long periods, bandwidth is a factor to consider.</p>
<p>The most significant benefit of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather misleading on where they are looking at. You can never ever tell by looking at it in range.
