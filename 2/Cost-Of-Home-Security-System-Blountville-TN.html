<p>Really merely, the person at the door presses the button. You'll get a notice to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you want a doorbell sound too.)

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
