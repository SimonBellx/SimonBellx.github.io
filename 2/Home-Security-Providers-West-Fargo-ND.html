Modern systems now have sensational abilities", though these have developed easy to understand misgivings about the danger for personal privacy and potential abuse such capabilities create. Porter therefore kept in mind that the Home Office and surveillance market must make sure only software and hardware certified with appropriate requirements, such as Secure by Default, is installed in public and personal spaces alike.</p>
<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage option and others don't. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; nevertheless, absolutely nothing is recorded.
