<p>Most burglars enter your home or business when you aren't around. The come during the day, when you're likely to be at work or running errands. Far from dressing in a black catsuit, like you might have gained from the motion pictures, they'll put on a plain-clothes attire to blend in. Especially smart crooks will camouflage themselves as service or shipment personnel. They do not spend inordinate amounts of time gunning through your belongings. They work rapidly: most robberies are committed within a period of 10 minutes or less.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester said the specialist offered solid customer service: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensing units from my expense after choosing that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some issues with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
