<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
