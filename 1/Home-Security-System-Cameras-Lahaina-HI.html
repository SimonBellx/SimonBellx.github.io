<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
