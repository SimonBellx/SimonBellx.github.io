<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several years.

In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
