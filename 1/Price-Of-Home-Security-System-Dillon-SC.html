<p>Even though 1080p is normally the basic resolution for cameras we have actually tested, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensors. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things clearly.</p>

All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not believe that these problems change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current recommendation.</p>
