Outdoor security cameras inevitably cost more than their indoor cousins, because-- for beginners-- the requirement to be safeguarded from the elements.

<p>Frontpoint uses 5 packages and two monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester went with the Interactive strategy but ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm alert while on vacation, she had no way of gauging whether her home had been gotten into or if her feline had managed to trip the sensing unit. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
