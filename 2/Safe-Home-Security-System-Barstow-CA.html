Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
