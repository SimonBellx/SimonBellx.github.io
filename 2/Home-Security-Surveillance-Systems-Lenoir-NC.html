The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. However suicide aggressors are plainly not hindered by camera - and might even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can make sure - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited advantages that the system might supply in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi communicates with recorder that likewise has integrated in wifi. This option is rather popular due to the fact that no established wifi is required. The recorder has 2 jobs- taping the captured video and being a standalone wifi network.
