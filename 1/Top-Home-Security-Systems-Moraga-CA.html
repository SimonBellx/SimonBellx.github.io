<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive general per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
