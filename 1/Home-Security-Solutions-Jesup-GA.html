<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
