<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly attempted to provide it an appealing edge, and we need to give credit to its ability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time.

The previous, less expensive variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have actually a cable television attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit easier to screw up for possible trespassers.
