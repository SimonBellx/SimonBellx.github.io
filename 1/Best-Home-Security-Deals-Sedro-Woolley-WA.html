It's practically like an all-in-one security system, though it is course limited in regards to just how much of your residential or commercial property its single camera (with a 125-degree field of vision) can cover.</p>

<p>Our experience with expert installation was blended. Our tester said the specialist supplied strong client service: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensing units from my costs after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home."
