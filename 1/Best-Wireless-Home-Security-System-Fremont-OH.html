The recorder has 2 tasks- tape-recording the recorded video and being a standalone wifi network. Right now Nest Secure has a couple of spaces in its security functions (like an alarm that instantly hold-ups by 30 seconds), but it's still worth thinking about-- especially if all you require is basic home security that you can monitor yourself.</p>

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
