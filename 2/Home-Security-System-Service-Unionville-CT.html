Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy given off by a things is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it emits.

And while this is a quite standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
