<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection devices are designed to protect specific, concrete possessions, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household treasures. These gadgets can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to avoid being deactivated. If the product to which the device has actually been attached is moved or disrupted, the sensor will trigger an alarm.</p>
