<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
