<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
