<p>These cameras are capable of catching and transmitting extremely sensitive information," says Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Lab. That's why we test them for information security and data personal privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or somebody, mostly to avoid or identify criminal offense. With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the help of electronic monitoring and video recording. It generally involves linking video cameras to an IP network or recording gadget and monitoring the feed.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of night, use and day images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.
