<p>Thanks to current developments in innovation, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you have actually decided to install an alarm system, you must consider the following advantages of wireless innovation. By combining LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other huge names in the market.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
