<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
