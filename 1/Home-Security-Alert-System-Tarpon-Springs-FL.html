<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets.

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a certified electrical contractor (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
