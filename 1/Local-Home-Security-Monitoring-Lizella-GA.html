Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>

<p>Because the glass real estate doesn't obstruct, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in abilities. As well as being excellent for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for infrared and low-light given that the glass real estate does not impede the lens.
