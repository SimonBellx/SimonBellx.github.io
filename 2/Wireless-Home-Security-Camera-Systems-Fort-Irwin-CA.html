<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop.
