<p>Another essential subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>

If there are no as-built files providing functionality and setup info to make this integration work, there are just two options.

The other approach is to rip and change, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
