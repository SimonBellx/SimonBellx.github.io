<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
