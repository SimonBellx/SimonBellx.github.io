<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face acknowledgment software application. The latter enables you to see specifically when a specific individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

<p>We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a sensible cost, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
