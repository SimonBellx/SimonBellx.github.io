<p>Yes, house owners can pick to self-monitor" their home security system.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year contract, but because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So select what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the contract and reap those cost savings if you know you'll remain put for at least 3 years.

<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary.

Having the ability to distinguish between a vehicle and a person, for example, enables you to cut down on unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
