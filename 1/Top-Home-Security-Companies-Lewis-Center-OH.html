<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal.

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was developed for homeowners. It needs to be installed by an expert alarm installation team and, when set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more typical for big homes and are typically more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system.
