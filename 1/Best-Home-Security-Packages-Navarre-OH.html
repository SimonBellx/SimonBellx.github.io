When it comes to the EZVIZ Complete HD Indoor Smart Security Camera in our best security camera round-up, the pros far outweigh the cons: it has a solid 1080p video feed, night vision, a good 135-degree field of vision, two-way audio and a straightforward app. Aside from the name, ADT likewise has a wide range of security equipment to safeguard your home.
