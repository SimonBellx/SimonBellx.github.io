As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
