However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

If there are 3 choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can only view one. This develops a one in 3 opportunity of capturing a specific event on video (either live or recorded).
