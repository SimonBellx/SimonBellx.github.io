As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
