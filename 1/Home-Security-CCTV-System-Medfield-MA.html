While the company doesn't provide rather as many hours of customer support as other brands, it has a fantastic credibility with great deals of vocal, pleased customers. Some companies charge for service calls, others may not. Normally, a service call includes a trip charge and a per hour labor cost. Customers have to speak with their alarm company to identify these prices because they differ from company to company.</p>
<p>A couple of things stick out about Link Interactive compared to other companies-- particularly the much shorter contracts. Most alarm companies make you sign a three-year contract, however Link uses contracts as brief as one year.

<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is in between taping and finding movement. Because the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to really turn on when it finds motion. They might get past the camera prior to it had time to record them if a wicked crook was quickly enough.</p>
<p>These cameras do not require a video capture card due to the fact that they work utilizing a digital signal which can be saved straight to a computer system. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be attained with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of area to be taken up versus the quality of image required or preferred). The highest image quality of DVD is only somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
