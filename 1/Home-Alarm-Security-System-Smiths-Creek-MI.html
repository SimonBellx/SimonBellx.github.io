<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. Non-traditional networks such as personal network Bluetooth gadgets are not safe from hacking and needs to be regarded as a security risk.

<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home invasion emergency. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm.

To recover expenses and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and provide physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to call for cops reaction.</p>

<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies?
