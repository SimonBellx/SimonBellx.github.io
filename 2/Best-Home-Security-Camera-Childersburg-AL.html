<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>Conserve money and time on installation with a wireless security system. Without the requirement to run video cable televisions, wireless monitoring systems use both flexibility and convenience. Not all coax cable must be utilized for CCTV camera installations. RG59 coax cable is the industry requirement and best choice for CCTV systems and HD over coax systems.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to opt for a Do It Yourself system or select an expertly set up system, you'll need to pay a month-to-month or annual  cost if you require monitoring, and in some cases, you'll be hit with a month-to-month cost to settle the cost of hardware components. With the majority of Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any regular monthly charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. If you commit to a three-year contract, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus strategy opts for $10 monthly and doesn't need an agreement.</p>

<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
