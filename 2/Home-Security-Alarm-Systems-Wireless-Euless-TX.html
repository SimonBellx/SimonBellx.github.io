If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not believe that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
