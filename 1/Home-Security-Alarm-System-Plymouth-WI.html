<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
