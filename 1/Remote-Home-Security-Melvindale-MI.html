<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
