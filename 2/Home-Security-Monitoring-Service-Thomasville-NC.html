The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the malicious attacker to tape these codes and utilize different cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system.
