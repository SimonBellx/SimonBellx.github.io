We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
