It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion.
