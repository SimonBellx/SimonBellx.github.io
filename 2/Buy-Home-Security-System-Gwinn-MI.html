<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

Centralizing security into a single user interface offers extra information that might never have been possible previously, such as alert of an employee, by name and recognition number, getting in the structure. A picture of that employee is presented on screen for confirmation (confirming it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating happens.</p>
