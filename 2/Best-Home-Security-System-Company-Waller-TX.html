<p>I feel this is a low-cost way to go if you don't desire monitored name brand alarm.

Renters and others who are uncertain how long they will be remaining in their existing home should prevent getting into long-term agreements.

<p>We like all the features the Kasa Area uses that make it such excellent worth and one of the best security cameras on the market: two-way audio, night vision, 1080p HD recording, custom activity zones and more.

ADT uses both landline and cellular monitoring. Landline monitoring might appear old-fashioned, however if you do not have reputable cell service in your location, it's the best choice.

<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to add extra features, like a security camera.
