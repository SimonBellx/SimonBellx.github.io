<p>The Nest Cam Indoor is the 3rd generation of the celebrated Dropcam-- among the first, and among the best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up almost anywhere indoors. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it engages with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke alarm, along with many third-party clever- home gadgets. But to truly use the camera's functions, you'll need to spend $10 or more per month for the Nest Aware program, which provides you access to cloud storage, person detection and customizable activity zones.</p>
