Representatives will frequently ask concerns about the latter in order to appropriately price quote the equipment, prepare for installation, and suggest add-on products.

<p>ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all sell pet-friendly motion detectors when it comes to indoor security equipment. Their detectors utilize infrared technology, so its harder for a dog or feline to trip the sensing unit. Vivint's sensors are unsusceptible to animals weighing up to 33 to 55 pounds.
