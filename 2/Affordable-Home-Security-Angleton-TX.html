<p>Any clever security system worth its salt uses components that collaborate in a smooth environment and can be manipulated using tailored guidelines. For example, you can create rules to have the lights switch on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensing unit is triggered. Some systems keep recorded video locally on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others use cloud storage. In your area stored video is a good choice for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, but you have to be careful not to overwrite video you may require later. Cloud storage makes it simple to shop and access taped video, however it can cost hundreds of dollars annually depending on your membership.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
