<h2>Video Surveillance And Monitoring Homepage Angier</h2>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>A lot of home security systems include Do It Yourself installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process.

<p>If you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at, there's no usage in having an outdoor security camera.

<p>Incorrect Alarms - Permitted 3 (complimentary) in a 12-month period. They do not work. In New York a guy got stabbed and was delegated die in front of 3 surveillance cameras. It took the ambulances 2 hours to get to the hurt male, and he passed away before getting to the medical facility. The surveillance cameras did nothing to assist the man.
