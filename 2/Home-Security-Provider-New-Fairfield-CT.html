These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
