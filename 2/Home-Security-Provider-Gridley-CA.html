<p>Think of it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low rate of forty dollars?

Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations.
