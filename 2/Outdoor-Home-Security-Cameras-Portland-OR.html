On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other clever home tech to the system. It won't deal with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely excellent, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensing unit in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
