Which's what Nest gives you.</p>

<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system counts on a gadget called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It serves as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensing units and 3rd party-devices via Z-Wave and managing them using the app or voice control. ADT provides monitored security packages that are customized to safeguard your home.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If recording video footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered the camera controls, I was fairly pleased. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the individual being seen understand they're being enjoyed, and you can select to tape-record video or photos and save them to your clever device on a whim. </p>
