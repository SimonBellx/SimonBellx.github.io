<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
