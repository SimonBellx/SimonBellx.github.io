<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the minimal variety of sensing units. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly innovative, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So pick what will be the better offer for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, choose the agreement and gain those cost savings.
