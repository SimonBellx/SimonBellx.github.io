<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
