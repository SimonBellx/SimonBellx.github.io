<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
