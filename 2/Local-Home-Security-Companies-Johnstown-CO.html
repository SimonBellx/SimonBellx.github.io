We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If catching video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
