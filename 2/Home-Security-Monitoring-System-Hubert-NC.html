We enjoy that the system includes a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensing units and essential fobs, too.</p>
