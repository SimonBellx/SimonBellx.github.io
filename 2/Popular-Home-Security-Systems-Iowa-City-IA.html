Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have a few of the very best functions on the market, including video analytics and 4K image sensing units (in addition to more basic fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>

Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end.
