<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
