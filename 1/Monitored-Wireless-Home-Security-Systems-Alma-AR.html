<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
