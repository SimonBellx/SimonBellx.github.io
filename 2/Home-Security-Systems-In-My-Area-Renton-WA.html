The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the destructive assailant to record these codes and use different cracking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
