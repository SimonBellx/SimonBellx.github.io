The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Many sites requiring alarm setups no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer ability do not work dependably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
