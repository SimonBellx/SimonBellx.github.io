<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it ought to be. Recordings, signals, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that they work using a digital signal which can be conserved straight to a computer system, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be taken up versus the quality of photo required or desired). The greatest picture quality of DVD is just somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
