<p>During our research study we faced a couple of surprises. For one the large majority of home security system notifies to the authorities are incorrect alarms.

<p>Think of it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced camera be cost the low rate of forty dollars? It just does not accumulate. To offer such low prices, manufacturers need to cut corners, and completion outcome is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in ideal conditions like brilliant sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain scenarios such as baby-sitter cameras or checking in on a pet, though when aiming to gather evidence of a criminal activity they often lose.</p>
<p>Many monitoring companies will first reach out to you so that they can know if the alarm was genuine or if it was an accident.
