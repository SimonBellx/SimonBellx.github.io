<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
