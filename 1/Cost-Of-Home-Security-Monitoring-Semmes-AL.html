<h3>Burglar Alarm System For Home in Semmes AL</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
