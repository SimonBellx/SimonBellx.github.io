<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Activity notices signal the user whenever substantial activity is detected near the camera. Discover if you can get notifications through push alerts, text, and or email. They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, particularly for cameras. And to be honest, we're not extremely impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first location. What you're spending for is primarily that huge name in blue. </p>
