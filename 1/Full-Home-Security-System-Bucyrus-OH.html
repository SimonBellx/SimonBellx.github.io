<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for catching a thief in the act, though. They're also beneficial for casual home monitoring. Placed on shelves, tables, and countertops, they enable you to watch on what your family pets are doing, understand when the kids come home from school, or discover who's been hitting the alcohol cabinet. Many even permit you to interact with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, via an embedded microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security strategy, the very same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you. Having an expert set up the system may provide you more confidence than if you did the work yourself if you're not mechanically inclined.

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-efficient monitoring strategy starting at $10. You can get all the basics like push, email, and sms notifies, along with 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most affordable, Always On" plan. However, you will need to spend for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) each month, and this does not included professional monitoring.
