<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such occurrences.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't think that these issues modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
