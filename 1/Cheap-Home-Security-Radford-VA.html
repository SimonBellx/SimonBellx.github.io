We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
