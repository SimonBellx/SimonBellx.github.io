<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
