<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was fairly impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being viewed understand they're being watched, and you can pick to tape video clips or photos and save them to your wise gadget on a whim. </p>
