We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
