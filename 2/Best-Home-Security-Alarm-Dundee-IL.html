<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
