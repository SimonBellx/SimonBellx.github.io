However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
