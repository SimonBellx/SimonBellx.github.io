<p>Unfortunately, almost every wireless gadget can be a potential target for hackers. Sadly, security systems are no exception.

Alexa support is included, as you would anticipate from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera properly manages all the typical functions when it pertains to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
