<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a detailed understanding of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and setup details to make this integration work, there are only two choices. The very first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is reluctant or unavailable to provide those information) and record the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to change and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
