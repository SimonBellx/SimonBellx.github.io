<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
