<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
