For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might recollect when you picture a home security camera. The very first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box.

The highest photo quality of DVD is only somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
