<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Our experience with professional installation was mixed. Our tester said the service technician offered solid client service: He dropped a few unneeded window sensing units from my expense after choosing that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some issues with connecting the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
