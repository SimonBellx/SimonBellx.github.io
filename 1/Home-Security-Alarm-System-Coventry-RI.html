<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level.
