<p>Another essential topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much suffices.

<p>Slightly more costly than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as basic to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensors had been activated. We enjoy that the system includes a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is produced by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false alerts).

Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control panel does require to be set up by a expert and linked  to a power source.
