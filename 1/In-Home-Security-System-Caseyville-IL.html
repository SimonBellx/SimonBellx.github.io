That way when a door is opened, or a camera is passed by, you will be alerted.

<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much is enough.

The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>

<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is usually cost-free. A cloud storage alternative conserves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is typically a paid service and the number of hours it will save will depend upon how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
