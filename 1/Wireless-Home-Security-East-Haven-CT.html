<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
