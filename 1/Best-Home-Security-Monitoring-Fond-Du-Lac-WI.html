<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send alerts, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even trigger false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur regularly enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>

However for common applications, connection concerns are controlled by typical supervision messages, sent daily or weekly. </p>
