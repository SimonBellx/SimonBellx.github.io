Reliability has long been at the heart of the debate over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a debate that's often manipulated by aspects such as hesitation over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and glitches that trigger incorrect alarms. While enhancements in the last few years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be hindered by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
