<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
