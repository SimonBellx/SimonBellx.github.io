<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel essentially susceptible. A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply wouldn't link. An assistance window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was an issue with the circuit board. Certainly not ideal-- but the associate said sorry and delivered her replacement control board over night.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed main monitoring station. All of the cameras in a given system need a main video recorder in order to send and archive the video footage they are recording. DVRs developed from the older VCR designs, while NVRs represent the next step in the evolution of video recording technology. Here's a side-by-side look at how DVRs and NVRs compare.</p>

<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it identifies an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the gadget to act as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
