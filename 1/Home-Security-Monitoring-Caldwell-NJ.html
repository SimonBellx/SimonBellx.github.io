Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur regularly enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
