<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
