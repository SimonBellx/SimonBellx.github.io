<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. If capturing video in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
