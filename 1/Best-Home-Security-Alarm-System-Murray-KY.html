Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
