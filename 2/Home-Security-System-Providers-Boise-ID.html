<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for incorrect alarms, and lower the number of unnecessary cops and fire responses. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and need to be teaching their clients how to appropriately set and care for their alarm. National and local statistics have actually proven that raising fines paid directly by companies and house owners have actually had no significant effect on lowering the number of false alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have delighted in the benefit of police action to their customers' alarms with no accountability for the accuracy or reliability of those alarms.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
