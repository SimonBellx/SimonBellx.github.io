<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated.

If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
