The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the harmful aggressor to record these codes and utilize various breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential captured throughout the network healing.</p>
