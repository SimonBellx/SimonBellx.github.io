Unlike Nest, TP-Link doesn't make you sign up for a feature strategy to get the most out of the Kasa Camera Outdoor. By simply buying the camera, you already get things like custom activity zones, and TP-Link is relatively generous with its complimentary cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history).</p>

If you have big pets, you might wish to think about skipping the motion sensing units and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't set off by movement but are activated when a window or door is opened.</p>
