<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can use access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, particularly relaying network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and smart hubs.

Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
