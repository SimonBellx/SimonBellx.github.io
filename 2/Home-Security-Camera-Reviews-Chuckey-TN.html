So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they automobile restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a composed not by mail.

It will tape clips when it views motion (and a couple of seconds prior to so you get the full view of what took place) and you can view these for a week before they're erased. You can extend the amount of days you manage buying a membership, however I don't think most people will require that option.</p>
