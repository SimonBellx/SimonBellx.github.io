So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because apparently they vehicle renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too costly, and not fantastic.</p>
