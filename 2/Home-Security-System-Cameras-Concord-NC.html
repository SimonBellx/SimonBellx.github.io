<p>Most of the self-monitored starter sets don't include outdoor cameras. Outdoor cameras are a little more difficult to install because they have to be mounted to a home. Outside security cameras are also more pricey because they are made to stand up to the aspects.

With some, it's tough to tell at a glimpse where they have actually been intended, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their true field of vision.
