<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more affordable subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.

On the downside, when motion detection is activated, its cameras are occasionally excessively delicate and send alerts even if minimal motion outside has actually been found.
