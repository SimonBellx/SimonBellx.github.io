<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable.

<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to frighten intruders most of the times. To hold and recoup expenses alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you.
