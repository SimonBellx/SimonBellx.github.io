<p>Even though 1080p is typically the standard resolution for cameras we have actually tested, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensing units.

These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as lot of times as you want.</p>
