Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>The Nest Cam Indoor is the 3rd generation of the well known Dropcam-- one of the first, and one of the best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p.

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your smart outlets with your overall security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
