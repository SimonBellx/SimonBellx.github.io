<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
