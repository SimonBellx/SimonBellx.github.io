<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Show, if you have among those) - and given that it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the person at the door if you so desire. Helpful if, for instance, it's the postman and you're out. You can instruct him or her where to leave the goods.</p>
<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see precisely when a specific individual reaches the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to introduce a smart smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even much better proposal.</p>
