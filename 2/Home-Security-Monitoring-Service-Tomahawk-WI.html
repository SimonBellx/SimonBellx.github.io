<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we don't think that these concerns modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current recommendation.</p>
