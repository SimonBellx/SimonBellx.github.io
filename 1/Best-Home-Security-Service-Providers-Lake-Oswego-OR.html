<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

Once a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, text, or e-mail website.
