<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and enjoy it later.

<p>Based on our evaluation, nevertheless, there are a number of disadvantages to choosing Frontpoint Security.
