<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of up to one year of battery life.

We have actually noticed some improvements considering that the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this review and check, as needed.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection.

The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
