<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>

However, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
