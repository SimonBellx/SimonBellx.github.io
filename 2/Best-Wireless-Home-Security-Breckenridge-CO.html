<p>Like any item that connects to the web and uses wireless technology, smart home security systems are susceptible to hacking, particularly systems that lack encryption. Hackers can sit outside your home and utilize a laptop computer and software application to obstruct wireless signals originating from your system that permit them to suppress alarms and disable sensors. Other devices allow hackers to produce radio sound that can jam interactions in between the sensors and the center.</p>
