There are just two choices if there are no as-built documents offering functionality and setup info to make this combination work. The very first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is not available or reluctant to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.
