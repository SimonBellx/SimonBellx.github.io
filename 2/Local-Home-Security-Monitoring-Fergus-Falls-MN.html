<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more budget-friendly memberships out there at $2.99 a month.

Many sites requiring alarm setups no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
