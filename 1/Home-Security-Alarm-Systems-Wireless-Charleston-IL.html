<p>Another essential subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
