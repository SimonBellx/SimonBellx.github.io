<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole household will enjoy. Professional installation with professional monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT expertly install and monitor your system-- you don't need to lift a finger or babysit signals. Over my 25 plus year profession in the security market, I have researched, sold, set up, and due to the fact that we have our own main station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I want to admit.</p>
