<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

For my money, systems like these offer a few of the very best worth for your home security dollar.</p>
