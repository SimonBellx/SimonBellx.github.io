<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to find what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are looking for in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we merely type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have a powerful solution for collecting and capturing wrongdoers proof.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year contract, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So select what will be the better offer for you. If you understand you'll stay put for at least three years, choose the agreement and gain those cost savings. However if you may upgrade to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is important. In truth, we don't suggest buying this camera at all unless you prepare to add the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between an individual and a cars and truck, for example, enables you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
