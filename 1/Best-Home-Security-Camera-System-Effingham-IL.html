<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
