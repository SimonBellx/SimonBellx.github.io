<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the 3rd generation of the well known Dropcam-- among the first, and among the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be installed nearly anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it communicates with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, along with many third-party wise- home devices. But to actually use the camera's functions, you'll need to pay out $10 or more per month for the Nest Aware program, which gives you access to cloud storage, person detection and personalized activity zones.</p>
<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate inside or indoors - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is simple to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the reassurance of expert monitoring.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
