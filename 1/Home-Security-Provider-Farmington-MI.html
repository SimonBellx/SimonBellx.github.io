<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
