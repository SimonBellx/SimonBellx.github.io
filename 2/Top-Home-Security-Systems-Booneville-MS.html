<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly attempted to provide it an appealing edge, and we need to offer credit to its ability to show what's going on from up to four cameras at a time.

The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have a cable attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit much easier to undermine for potential trespassers.
