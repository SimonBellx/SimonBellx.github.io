Our tester selected the Interactive strategy but wound up discontented with its absence of live video surveillance.

<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built files providing performance and configuration information to make this integration work, there are just two alternatives.

The other technique is to replace and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
