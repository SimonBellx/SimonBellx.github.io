<p>Still, if technology has made us vulnerable, then it can likewise make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pushing hard to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera area. Big investments by the similarity Google-owned Nest, Amazon's Blink, and up-and-coming security company Ring have made home security cameras more prominent.</p>
<p>The density of access points can even be an issue - there are a minimal number of channels available, and they partly overlap. Each channel can manage numerous networks, but locations with lots of private wireless networks (for instance, apartment building), the limited variety of Wi-Fi radio channels might cause slowness and other problems.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface provides extra information that may never ever have been possible in the past, such as notice of a worker, by name and recognition number, entering the building. An image of that worker is presented on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating occurs.</p>

<p>To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm systems is practical. Although there are a variety of extra system elements offered including smoke alarm and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm includes three primary elements: a keypad control board, private sensors, and a manned monitoring station.</p>
<p>I described that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if needed, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
