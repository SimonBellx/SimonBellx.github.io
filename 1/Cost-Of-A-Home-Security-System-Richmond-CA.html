<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
