The typical factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing a chance for the malicious opponent to record these codes and use various breaking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system.
