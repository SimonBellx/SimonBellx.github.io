We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect signals). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have essential fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>
