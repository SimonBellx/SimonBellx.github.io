<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 each month, which could be a cost effective alternative for consumers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems because they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>
<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt should be able to endure exposure to the elements and must bring an IP (Ingress Protection) score IP scores consist of two digits that inform you simply how well the camera will hold up under a lot of weather.

The 2nd number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (secured versus close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
