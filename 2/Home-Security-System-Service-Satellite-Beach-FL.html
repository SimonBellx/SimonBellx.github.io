<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make clients stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. Alexa support is included, as you would anticipate from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera effectively manages all the normal functions when it concerns motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
