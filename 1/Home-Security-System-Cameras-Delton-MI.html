You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disturbance, and it seldom sends false informs because it tracks your phone (and other family member's phones), so understands when you're at home and turns everything off. Similarly, it will equip itself instantly when everyone has actually left.</p>
