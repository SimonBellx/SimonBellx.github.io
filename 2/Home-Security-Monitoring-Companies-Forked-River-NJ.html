<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (usually located in the entryway hall) that is utilized to equip and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours).
