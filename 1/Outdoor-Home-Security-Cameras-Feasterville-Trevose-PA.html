<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to offer it an attractive edge, and we need to give credit to its capability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time. It can be sluggish and uncomfortable to use on occasion - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have a cable television connected however, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit much easier to sabotage for possible intruders.
