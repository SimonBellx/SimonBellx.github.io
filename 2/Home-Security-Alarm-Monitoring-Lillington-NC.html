While it provides terrific imagination, it will require more effort than the existing top choices.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to detect it.
