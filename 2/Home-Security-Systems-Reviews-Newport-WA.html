We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect signals). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have additional sensing units and key fobs, too.</p>
