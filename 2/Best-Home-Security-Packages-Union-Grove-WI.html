<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
