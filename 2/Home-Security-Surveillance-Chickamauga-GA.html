<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
