<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences.
