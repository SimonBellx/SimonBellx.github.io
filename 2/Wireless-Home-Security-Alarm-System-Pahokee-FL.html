I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that obviously they vehicle renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.

<p>However while SimpliSafe has less customer support availability, it uses monetary versatility that ADT does not match. Since SimpliSafe monitoring strategies are optional, you can cancel your monitoring service whenever if you need extra money for holiday presents, medical costs, or moving expenditures. And because SimpliSafe has no contracts, it doesn't charge fees for canceling your month-to-month plan.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often paired with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the facilities control unit contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as contacting homeowner, informing police, or dispatching personal security forces. Such signals may be sent through devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they record; everything within their focus capability is recorded. That is to say, CCTV cameras are quite un-focused when it comes to isolating the images of an active event about to take place. However you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to add to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
