What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have actually seen some enhancements given that the camera's launch, and will continue to test and update this evaluation, as needed.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, setting up a security system could be a very pricey affair: An expert monitoring company would supply the gear, locking you into a costly, multi-year contract.

It will tape clips when it sees movement (and a few seconds prior to so you get the full view of what happened) and you can view these for a week prior to they're deleted.
