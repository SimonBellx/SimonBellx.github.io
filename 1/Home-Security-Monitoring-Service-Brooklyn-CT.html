When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
