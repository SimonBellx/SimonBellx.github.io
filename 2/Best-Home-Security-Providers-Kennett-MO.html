<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
