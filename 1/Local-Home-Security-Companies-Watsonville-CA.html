The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.

What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in ideal conditions like intense sunlight?
