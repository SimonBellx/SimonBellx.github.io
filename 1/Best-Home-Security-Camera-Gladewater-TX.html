<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
