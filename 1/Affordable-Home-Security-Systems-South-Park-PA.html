<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning period).

They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll likewise pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras.
