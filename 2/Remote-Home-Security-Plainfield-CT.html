<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

<p>After checking out the discuss this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they offered; they've partnered with another security company and their starter plan I believe starts at $0 down.

If you include monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. The rate of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you dedicate to a three-year agreement. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 per month and doesn't need an agreement.</p>
