<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
