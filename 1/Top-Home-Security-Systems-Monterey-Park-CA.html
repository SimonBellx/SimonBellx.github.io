<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
