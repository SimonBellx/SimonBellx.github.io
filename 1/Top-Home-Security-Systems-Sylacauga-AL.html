<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
