Commercial properties tend to have even higher false alarm rates than homes because more individuals tend to share duty for triggering and deactivating the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more complicated. The rate of incorrect alarms for commercial alarm users may be as much as three times greater than the rate of incorrect alarms among residential alarm users. 9 Persistent false alarm activations are typically due to insufficient worker training or inferior systems that have not been updated.</p>
