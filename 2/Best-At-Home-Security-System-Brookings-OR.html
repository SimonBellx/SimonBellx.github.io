<p>Somewhat more pricey than our winning smart alarm, this system was nearly as simple to install and, throughout screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensors had been activated. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false alerts). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
