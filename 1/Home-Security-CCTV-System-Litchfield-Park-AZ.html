<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send signals, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>The report, entitled Is your CCTV system secure from cyber attack?, says there are "major vulnerabilities" in both traditional DVR-based CCTV systems, as well as cloud-based video systems. Hackers can "easily" pirate connections to the device's IP address, putting a great deal of individuals, their residential or commercial properties and data at danger. </p>
