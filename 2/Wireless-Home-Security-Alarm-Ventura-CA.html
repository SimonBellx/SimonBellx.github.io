So if Amazon hopes to consume some of that market, it needs to offer something similar.

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more affordable subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is a pricey security camera, but we think it deserves the financial investment.
