<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful aggressor, since the disruption of the network prevents the flow of data and actually indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being transferred. The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering an opportunity for the malicious attacker to record these codes and use numerous splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system.
