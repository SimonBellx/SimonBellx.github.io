The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the destructive opponent to tape these codes and use different cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key caught during the network healing.</p>
