If the camera discovers a face it does not identify, it will send out an alert and image to your phone, enabling you to give that person the once over. If it's somebody getting up to no good, the camera will follow their motions and conserve the timestamp, so you can quickly discover it in the future.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
