It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
