<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've labeled (after a learning duration).

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
