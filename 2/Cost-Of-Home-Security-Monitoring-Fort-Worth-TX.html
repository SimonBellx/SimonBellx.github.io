<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
