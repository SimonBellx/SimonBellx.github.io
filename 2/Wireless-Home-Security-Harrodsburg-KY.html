The scientists searched for CCTV assessments released between 2007 and 2017 to represent the period since the last review (which covered examinations completed in 2006 and earlier). Methods consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and calling leading scientists to inquire about upcoming examinations. Both published and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
