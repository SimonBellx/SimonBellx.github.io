When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
