<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
