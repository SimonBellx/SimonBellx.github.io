<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, but it's not a lot when you think about that a live human is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras identify suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's center can warn a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, however it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
