<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>If you do come across a home intrusion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm.
