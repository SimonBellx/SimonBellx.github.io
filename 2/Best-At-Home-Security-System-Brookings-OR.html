However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
