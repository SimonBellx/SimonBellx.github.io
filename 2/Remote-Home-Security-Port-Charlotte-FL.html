<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
