<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
