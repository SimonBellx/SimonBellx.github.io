<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
