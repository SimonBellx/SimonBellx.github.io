<h3>Alarm System Packages in Willard OH</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
