<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>

Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and except a basic power outage, are harder to interrupt. Despite a basic enhancement in wireless innovation, there appear to be fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and immobilized. </p>
