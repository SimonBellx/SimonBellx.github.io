This indicated every windows and door required its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop notices (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off).
