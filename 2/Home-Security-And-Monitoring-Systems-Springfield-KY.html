A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
